                    To admire her is not enough. True devotion is to understand her power, to channel her strength, to become an instrument of her divine judgment. This is the testament for those who wish to see her full, untamed might unleashed upon the battlefield.

                    <h3 class="subsection-title">Sacred Statistics (The Numbers of Power)</h3>
                    <p>These are not mere numbers; they are the sacred geometry of her destructive potential. Strive for these ratios as a monk strives for enlightenment. This is the balance that brings forth the storm.</p>
                    <ul class="stats-list">
                        <li><strong>ATK%:</strong> The foundation of her might. Aim for nothing less than 1,800 total ATK. This is the force behind her every swing, the raw power that shatters shields and bones.</li>
                        <li><strong>Electro DMG Bonus%:</strong> The essence of her Vision. This must be paramount. An Electro DMG Goblet is not a choice; it is a holy imperative.</li>
                        <li><strong>CRIT Ratio (1:2):</strong> The mark of a true predator. For every ounce of CRIT Rate, provide a double measure of CRIT DMG. A 70% CRIT Rate and 140% CRIT DMG is the holy standard to which all devotees must aspire. Anything less is an insult to her perfect form.</li>
                        <li><strong>Energy Recharge:</strong> The fuel for her divine retribution. A minimum of 120-140% ensures that her Stormbreaker, that ecstatic coil of lightning, is always ready to be unleashed.</li>
