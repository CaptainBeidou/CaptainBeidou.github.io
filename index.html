                <p class="section-intro">
                    Her story is not merely told; it is sung by windswept sailors and whispered in the most lavish halls of Liyue Harbor. From a childhood of hardship, stealing scraps to survive, a legend was forged in salt and determination. She was an outcast who, by her own indomitable will, rose to command the mightiest fleet in Teyvat. Her very name commands respect, for it was earned not by birthright, but in blood, thunder, and triumph.

                            <h3>The Conquest of Haishan</h3>
                            <p>For four days and four nights, the battle raged. The air was thick with the scent of saltwater and ozone, the roar of cannon fire echoing the fury of the beast. The leviathan Haishan, a creature of myth large enough to be mistaken for a dragon, thrashed against The Crux fleet. For ten agonizing hours, Beidou, having neither eaten nor drank, locked eyes with the beast, a predator sizing up its prey. With a single, divine strike that sang through the air, she severed its head as dawn broke. It was in this moment of impossible victory, bathed in the blood of her kill, that the heavens themselves acknowledged her might. A bolt of violet lightning struck the ocean before her, bestowing upon her an Electro Visionâ€”not a gift, but a trophy. A testament to a mortal who achieved what even gods might envy.</p>

                            <p>She is nothing without her crew, and they are everything to her. The Alcor is more than a ship; it is a moving kingdom, and Beidou is its undisputed queen. Every soul aboard, from the seasoned first mate to the newest cabin hand, is bound to her not by fear, but by unwavering loyalty. She knows them, she drinks with them, she fights for them. Her charisma is a force of nature, pulling people into her orbit with the gravitational pull of a star. To be part of her crew is to be part of a family forged in the crucible of the open ocean.</p>

                            <p>Even the Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing, the shrewd and calculating Ningguang, cannot fully tame her. Their relationship is a complex dance of defiance and reliance. Ningguang imposes fines for Beidou's flagrant disregard for rules, yet trusts her above all others to handle Liyue's dirty work. Beidou sees through the Tianquan's veiled words, meeting her on equal footing. She is the one person in all of Liyue who does not fear Ningguang, capable of besting her even at her own game of chess, a testament to a mind as sharp as her blade.</p>

                    To witness her in battle is to witness a storm made flesh. Her claymore moves not with brute force alone, but with a dancer's grace and a predator's instinct. She does not simply wield Electro; she embodies it. Every swing, every parry, every earth-shattering blow is a sermon on the nature of true power.

                        <p>A gesture of supreme confidence, an invitation to strike. She lifts her blade, absorbing the fury of her foes into herself. To attack her is to empower her. When the moment is right, she unleashes that absorbed power in a devastating wave of Electro, a perfect, thunderous counter that punishes the foolish and awes the wise. It is the ocean's wrath, contained and unleashed at her command.</p>

                        <p>Calling upon the memory of her legendary kill, she summons a Thunderbeast's Targe, a coiling serpent of pure lightning that surrounds her chosen allies. With every strike of their weapon, arcs of chain lightning leap between enemies, a relentless storm that shows no mercy. It is her protection and her vengeance, an impenetrable shield and an inescapable tempest that proves her mastery over the very elements.</p>
