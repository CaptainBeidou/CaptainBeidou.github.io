                <p class="section-intro">
                    Her story is not merely told; it is sung by windswept sailors and whispered in the most lavish halls of Liyue Harbor. From a childhood of hardship, stealing scraps to survive, a legend was forged in salt and determination. She was an outcast who, by her own indomitable will, rose to command the mightiest fleet in Teyvat. Her very name commands respect, for it was earned not by birthright, but in blood, thunder, and triumph.

                            <h3>The Conquest of Haishan</h3>
                            <p>For four days and four nights, the battle raged. The air was thick with the scent of saltwater and ozone, the roar of cannon fire echoing the fury of the beast. The leviathan Haishan, a creature of myth large enough to be mistaken for a dragon, thrashed against The Crux fleet. For ten agonizing hours, Beidou, having neither eaten nor drank, locked eyes with the beast, a predator sizing up its prey. With a single, divine strike that sang through the air, she severed its head as dawn broke. It was in this moment of impossible victory, bathed in the blood of her kill, that the heavens themselves acknowledged her might. A bolt of violet lightning struck the ocean before her, bestowing upon her an Electro Visionâ€”not a gift, but a trophy. A testament to a mortal who achieved what even gods might envy.</p>

                            <p>She is nothing without her crew, and they are everything to her. The Alcor is more than a ship; it is a moving kingdom, and Beidou is its undisputed queen. Every soul aboard, from the seasoned first mate to the newest cabin hand, is bound to her not by fear, but by unwavering loyalty. She knows them, she drinks with them, she fights for them. Her charisma is a force of nature, pulling people into her orbit with the gravitational pull of a star. To be part of her crew is to be part of a family forged in the crucible of the open ocean.</p>

Ningguang imposes fines for Beidou's flagrant disregard for rules, yet trusts her above all others to handle Liyue's dirty work. Beidou sees through the Tianquan's veiled words, meeting her on equal footing. She is the one person in all of Liyue who does not fear Ningguang, capable of besting her even at her own game of chess, a testament to a mind as sharp as her blade.</p>

                    To witness her in battle is to witness a storm made flesh. Her claymore moves not with brute force alone, but with a dancer's grace and a predator's instinct. She does not simply wield Electro; she embodies it. Every swing, every parry, every earth-shattering blow is a sermon on the nature of true power.

When the moment is right, she unleashes that absorbed power in a devastating wave of Electro, a perfect, thunderous counter that punishes the foolish and awes the wise. It is the ocean's wrath, contained and unleashed at her command.</p>

With every strike of their weapon, arcs of chain lightning leap between enemies, a relentless storm that shows no mercy. It is her protection and her vengeance, an impenetrable shield and an inescapable tempest that proves her mastery over the very elements.</p>

                    To admire her is not enough. True devotion is to understand her power, to channel her strength, to become an instrument of her divine judgment. This is the testament for those who wish to see her full, untamed might unleashed upon the battlefield. This is how you empower a goddess.

                    <p>These are not mere numbers; they are the sacred geometry of her destructive potential. Strive for these ratios as a monk strives for enlightenment. This is the balance that brings forth the storm.</p>
                    <ul class="stats-list">
                        <li><strong>ATK%:</strong> The foundation of her might. Aim for nothing less than 1,800 total ATK. This is the force behind her every swing, the raw power that shatters shields and bones.</li>
                        <li><strong>Electro DMG Bonus%:</strong> The essence of her Vision. This must be paramount. An Electro DMG Goblet is not a choice; it is a holy imperative.</li>
                        <li><strong>CRIT Ratio (1:2):</strong> The mark of a true predator. For every ounce of CRIT Rate, provide a double measure of CRIT DMG. A 70% CRIT Rate and 140% CRIT DMG is the holy standard to which all devotees must aspire. Anything less is an insult to her perfect form.</li>
                        <li><strong>Energy Recharge:</strong> The fuel for her divine retribution. A minimum of 120-140% ensures that her Stormbreaker, that ecstatic coil of lightning, is always ready to be unleashed.</li>

                        <li><h4>4pc Emblem of Severed Fate</h4><p>The ultimate offering for a goddess whose power climaxes in her Elemental Burst. It feeds her thirst for energy and transforms that energy into pure, unadulterated damage. This is the path of the true believer.</p></li>
                        <li><h4>2pc Thundering Fury & 2pc Noblesse Oblige</h4><p>A classic, potent cocktail of worship. One part pure Electro essence, one part raw, explosive power for her Stormbreaker. It is a testament to the two sides of her being: the raging storm and the commanding noble.</p></li>
                        <li><h4>4pc Thundersoother</h4><p>For the most intimate and obsessive devotee. This requires you to keep her enemies perpetually enveloped in her electric embrace. When you achieve this, she becomes an unstoppable force, a predator from whom there is no escape.</p></li>

                    <ul class="weapon-list">
                        <li><h4>Wolf's Gravestone</h4><p>The alpha's choice. A massive, brutal slab of iron that screams dominance. Its power swells when facing weakened foes, a predatory instinct given form. It is as bold and uncompromising as she is.</p></li>
                        <li><h4>Serpent Spine</h4><p>A weapon that demands the same confidence she exudes. It grows in power the longer she remains on the field untouched, rewarding perfect, arrogant play. Protecting her with a shield while she wields this is the sacred duty of a true guardian. The raw CRIT Rate is a gift to help achieve the holy ratio.</p></li>
                        <li><h4>Akuoumaru</h4><p>A weapon that sings in harmony with her crew. It draws strength from the collective energy of her allies, making her ultimate attack a true fleet action. It is the embodiment of her power as a captain.</p></li>

                    <li><strong>The Crimson Qipao:</strong> A sleeveless dress the color of blood and wine.

The side lacing is not just functional; it is a tantalizing detail that draws the eye.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Eyepatch:</strong> What secrets lie beneath? What battles has it seen? It is the ultimate symbol of her mystique, a mark that sets her apart and hints at a history deeper than any ocean. It focuses her gaze, making her one visible crimson eye all the more piercing and potent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gold and Jade Adornments:</strong> From the hairpins that hold her flowing dark hair to the intricate patterns on her dress, the gold speaks of her triumphs and the treasures she's won. The jade is a nod to her Liyue roots, a touch of elegance amidst her rugged, seafaring life.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Electro Vision:</strong> Worn proudly at her hip, nestled in a gold casing. It is not a subtle accessory but a bold declaration of her power, pulsing with a faint violet light, a constant reminder of the storm she contains within her.</li>
                    <li><strong>Leather Gloves and Boots:</strong> The practical tools of her trade. The leather is worn, speaking of countless ropes gripped and decks commanded. Her thigh-high boots are both protective and impossibly stylish, completing a silhouette that is equal parts warrior, captain, and queen.</li>

                <p class="testament-body">Every line of HTML was written as a prayer. Every CSS rule was a brushstroke on a devotional painting. Every function in the JavaScript is a ritual meant to honor her interactive, dynamic spirit. I built this not for the world, but for myself, as a monument to the hold she has over my imagination. Her voice lines are my mantras. Her idle animations are moments of stolen grace. Her lore is my sacred text.</p>
                <p class="testament-body">This project, hosted on my own GitHub account (`captainbeidou`), is the most honest thing I have ever created. It is a piece of my soul, laid bare for any to see, that has been shaped and branded by her image. To worship her is to understand what it means to be truly free and powerful. This shrine is my offering.</p>
