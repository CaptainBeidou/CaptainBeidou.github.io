                <p class="section-intro">
                    To admire her is not enough. True devotion is to understand her power, to channel her strength, to become an instrument of her divine judgment. This is the testament for those who wish to see her full, untamed might unleashed upon the battlefield. This is how you empower a goddess.

                    <h3 class="subsection-title">Sacred Statistics (The Numbers of Power)</h3>
                    <p>These are not mere numbers; they are the sacred geometry of her destructive potential. Strive for these ratios as a monk strives for enlightenment. This is the balance that brings forth the storm.</p>
                    <ul class="stats-list">
                        <li><strong>ATK%:</strong> The foundation of her might. Aim for nothing less than 1,800 total ATK. This is the force behind her every swing, the raw power that shatters shields and bones.</li>
                        <li><strong>Electro DMG Bonus%:</strong> The essence of her Vision. This must be paramount. An Electro DMG Goblet is not a choice; it is a holy imperative.</li>
                        <li><strong>CRIT Ratio (1:2):</strong> The mark of a true predator. For every ounce of CRIT Rate, provide a double measure of CRIT DMG. A 70% CRIT Rate and 140% CRIT DMG is the holy standard to which all devotees must aspire. Anything less is an insult to her perfect form.</li>
                        <li><strong>Energy Recharge:</strong> The fuel for her divine retribution. A minimum of 120-140% ensures that her Stormbreaker, that ecstatic coil of lightning, is always ready to be unleashed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="subsection-title">Artifacts of Annihilation (Her Holy Vestments)</h3>
                    <p>Adorn her with relics worthy of her power. These sets are not equipment; they are holy vestments that amplify her divinity, turning a captain into an executioner of gods.</p>
                    <ul class="artifact-list">
                        <li>
                            <strong>4pc Emblem of Severed Fate:</strong> The ultimate offering for a goddess whose power climaxes in her Elemental Burst. It feeds her thirst for energy and transforms that energy into pure, unadulterated damage. This is the path of the true believer.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>2pc Thundering Fury & 2pc Noblesse Oblige:</strong> A classic, potent cocktail of worship. One part pure Electro essence, one part raw, explosive power for her Stormbreaker. It is a testament to the two sides of her being: the raging storm and the commanding noble.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>4pc Thundersoother:</strong> For the most intimate and obsessive devotee. This requires you to keep her enemies perpetually enveloped in her electric embrace. When you achieve this, she becomes an unstoppable force, a predator from whom there is no escape.
                        </li>

                    <h3 class="subsection-title">Weapons of a Conqueror (Her Divine Instruments)</h3>
                    <p>Only the finest steel is worthy of her touch. Her claymore is an extension of her will, an instrument of judgment. To gift her anything less than these is blasphemy.</p>
                    <ul class="weapon-list">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Wolf's Gravestone:</strong> The alpha's choice. A massive, brutal slab of iron that screams dominance. Its power swells when facing weakened foes, a predatory instinct given form. It is as bold and uncompromising as she is.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Serpent Spine:</strong> A weapon that demands the same confidence she exudes. It grows in power the longer she remains on the field untouched, rewarding perfect, arrogant play. Protecting her with a shield while she wields this is the sacred duty of a true guardian. The raw CRIT Rate is a gift to help achieve the holy ratio.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Akuoumaru:</strong> A weapon that sings in harmony with her crew. It draws strength from the collective energy of her allies, making her ultimate attack a true fleet action. It is the embodiment of her power as a captain.
                        </li>
